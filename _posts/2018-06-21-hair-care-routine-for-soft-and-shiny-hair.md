**The most attractive part of one’s personality is their hair. Healthy and soft hair enhance the looks of a person and make them look more neat and put together. But with today’s lifestyle it is difficult for everyone to maintain healthy hair. In this post I will be sharing a quick hair care routine for soft and shiny hair and you can add this to your lifestyle to flaunt super smooth and healthy hair to the world. let’s start:**

I know we all have been through our bad hair days and it’s really very annoying to go out with those greasy, frizzed and damaged hair. We all like to style and color our hair but it ultimately leads to a total mess and we are left with nothing but damaged and dull hair. It decreases our self esteem. So today i want to share my mantra and some tips of how i take care of my hair and how all of you can get extremely gorgeous hair without wasting money in salons and on hair treatments.

Everyone has different types of hair and i will be sharing a universal routine for managing soft and bouncy hair.

# Pre hair wash treatment

This is basically a scalp treatment where we start from the roots of our hair. it includes the following steps:

*Scaling*: It is the removal of dead skin present on the scalp which is blocking the scalp from breathing and also leading to weakening of the roots. You have to start from combing your hair properly from roots to tips. Then you can use scaling products available in the market like L’Oreal scaler or simply use small teeth comb to remove all the dead skin from the scalp. While combing you have to be really careful with the strokes as harsh strokes might irritate the scalp. comb your hairs with the small teeth comb for about 20 to 30 times.

*Oil or hair mask*: This step is for moisturization and hydration. one of the best Indian methods are over night oiling methods and they still help a lot of people in achieving healthy hair. But if you are running late or don’t have time for overnight oiling, then take a few drops of oil and massage it on your scalp for 15 minutes after scaling. As the roots are clean, the oil will penetrate into the skin quickly.for oiling you can use oils like olive oil, moroccon or argan oil, coconut oil or almond oil. Try using a natural oil instead of mineral or artificial oils. If you don’t like oils you can go for pre-shampoo treatments like L’Oreal clay mask or keratese mask.Just take a small amount on your palm and apply it from roots to tips.

*Steaming*: Now this is an important step but you can miss it if you are running late. This step is for deep moisture penetration and moisture locking. Just take a towel, dip it in hot water, squeeze it and then wrap your hairs in it after using oil or treatment. The steam will help in opening of pores and penetration of moisture inside the scalp. You can also buy a hair steamer for this purpose if you want.

# Shampoo and conditioning

This step is the most crucial step of anyone’s hair care routine. We experiment with various types of shampoos and conditioners and we keep on changing them again and again. Now we should always keep this in mind that all scalp types are different and the kind of shampoo and conditioners we use should be according to the needs of our scalp.

*Shampoo*: There are tons of shampoos available in the market. The first thing you should consider while buying a shampoo is how mild the ingredients are. make sure the shampoo contains less sulfates as it dries out and damages the scalp. Also look for shampoos that are natural and does not claim to give extra straight or shiny hairs as they contain more chemicals for this purpose. Look for shampoos that suits your scalp and hair type. Now while washing your hairs make sure you massage your scalp more with the shampoo and rub it less on tips as it might dry out your tips. Some of the shampoos i recommend for different hair types are: Kaya nourishing shampoo, L’Oreal professional volumetry shampoo, Himalaya damage repair protein shampoo, etc for dry hair and Neutrogena Shampoo The Anti-Residue Formula For Oily Hair, L’Oreal Paris extraordinary clay shampoo for oily hair.

*Conditioning*: Use conditioners that are mild and natural and use the same conditioner for the shampoo you are using. They are formulated for using together and gives best results with each other. Make sure that when you are conditioning your hair, you are just applying the conditioner on the bottom half of your hair and not in the scalp. Applying conditioner to the scalp can make it oily and greasy.

# Post washing treatment and care

After washing your hair you have to follow these steps to attain the best quality hair.

* Let your hair air dry.
* When your hair are damp, take a drop of almond or argan oil and rub it in your palm and then apply it on the tips of your hair. this will protect the hair from sun and pollution.
* Use a serum or hair cream after your hair are completely dry. This will provide a natural sheen and softness to your hair. Use a small quantity. You can use Garnier hair cream, Himalaya hair cream or L’Oreal serum for the same.
* After your hair completely dry, comb them by using a wide teeth comb and you are ready to go.

This routine is suitable for anyone who wants to have voluminous, shiny and soft hair. You can style your hair afterwards if its required.  Now i will be sharing some of my tips to have gorgeous hair:

* Drink Lots of water as hydration provides shine to skin and hair.
* Style your hair less.
* Wash your hair only 2 to 3 times a week as over washing can lead to damaged hair.
* Always comb your hair after they are completely dry.
* Use Aloevera gel on the tips of your hair to get rid of split ends.
